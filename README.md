# RubyMetrics Parsers
## Adapted from the RubyMetrics plugin for Hudson CI

This library provides the ability to parse ruby metric reports including Rcov, Rails stats, Rails notes and Flog.

Currently still has a lot of Hudson/Jenkins code for publishing results, but will be trimmed down to only include
the parsing of output files.

### Plans include:
* Removing all Hudson related code
